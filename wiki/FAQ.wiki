 # *I can't save profile (Mac OSX)*
  * The apple laf isn't implemented correctly in java, causing notSerializableException when trying to save a profile. Try changing the skin to say metal and save profile.
 # *I get a blank error message dialogue window when trying to connect.*
  * Check the log files and see what error message was thrown further down in the exception stack. Usually this is because you have an old version of xmlrpc-c. read the installation guide on this.
 # *Problem with large .torrent files? (XML-RPC request too large).*
  * look at Issue 25
 # *Suddenly have no torrents listed in nTorrent even though they exist in rTorrent.*
  * You have a torrent file that isn't using UTF-8 encoding, you should add this too your .rtorrent.rc config file: encoding_list = UTF-8, this will force UTF-8 communcation over XMLRPC
 # *nTorrent 0.5 fails to open in OSX 10.5.5 (Java 1.6 update installed)*
